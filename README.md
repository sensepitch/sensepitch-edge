Sensepitch Edge is a reverse proxy that improves the availability of web apps by absorbing malicious or excessive traffic, ensuring continuous, low‑latency service.

## Goals

- Ingress / reverse proxy for public facing web applications
- Replacement for other ingress controllers or reverse proxies like NGINX, Openresty, Caddy, Traefik
- Protection from malicious robots, DoS attacks or scanners
- Detect and don't block legitimate crawlers
- Make CAPTCHAs or other protection mechanisms within the applications redundant
- Improve site delivery performance, e.g. by SSL offloading, optimized HTTP protocol handling, caching, compression
- "Waiting room": Ensure healthy applications and consistent UX for users in high load situations and provide a sensible message to users that cannot be served at the moment 
- high concurrent and low latency operation, performance level similar to proven high RPS server like NGINX
- Sensible defaults for good OOTB experience

## Non Goals

- API gateway capabilities, like access control, rate limiting and accounting.
- Security enforcement

## Architecture

Sensepitch Edge is based on Netty, the Java VM and Boring SSL.

Netty provides a solid HTTP core implementation for more than a decade. On the other hand, Java was not a good choice for building edge servers. The problem is high startup times and unpredictable, stop the world, garbage collection pauses of one second or more. The GC pauses lead to response time spikes but also intermittent failures because of resource overflows when unprocessed requests are queued.

In 2025 the JDK’s ZGC virtually eliminates stop‑the‑world pauses (<2ms typical). The startup of Sensepitch Edge is already fast
because of its minimal dependencies. Additional techniques are available to reduce startup time, like GraalVM, s can be reduced more. Another approach to reduce startup times 
is the OpenJDK project (called project Leyden).

Traditionally, the JVM was avoided at the network edge because of long start‑up times and unpredictable “stop‑the‑world” garbage‑collection (GC) pauses. In 2025, however, the JDK's ZGC eliminates stop-the-world pauses. Because of the small footprint Sensepitch Edge already starts quickly. Adding additional technologies like class‑data sharing, GraalVM native images or the forthcoming OpenJDK **Project Leyden** can cut start‑up further.

## Performance

As we are still in the prototyping / proof of concept stage our main goal is to evaluate whether the chosen architecture is competitive in general. To do this, we compare it with a NGINX reverse proxy which is known to be highly optimized. 

- Hardware: Notebook with 8 core, AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 w/ Radeon 880M
- NGINX Version 1.29
- openjdk version "24.0.1" 2025-04-15
- Load generator: vegeta v12.12.0

The complete setup can be found under `performance-test`. The NGINX setup enables keep alive for upstream connection. However, using keep alive connections is a usual practice and the default for Sensepitch Edge.

The test is run on the developers' notebook with load generator, proxy and target webserver running on the same machine. While this is not ideal since it is not comparable to a production scenario, it is enough for our current purpose. 

For testing we use OpenJDK 24 and switch to ZGC for minimal pause times:

    java -XX:+UseZGC --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -jar target/sensepitch-edge-1.0-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar

For load testing we use vegeta:

    echo "GET $PROXY_URL/10kb.img" | vegeta attack -insecure -duration=10s -timeout=10s -rate=50000 -keepalive=true | vegeta report

Multiple runs were made and the first one discarded, to allow for warmup and keep alive connections to establish. The target rate of 50000 is above the achievable throughput on the test hardware to cause saturation.

The NGINX result is:

The resulting throughput for Sensepitch Edge is around 75% of the NGINX based reverse proxy. This can be considered "good enough" already. I did not do further profiling. One known bottleneck is the output of the access log requests to `System.out`, which causes lock contention. Noteworthy is the 10 times higher mean latency. I assume a probable cause is the fact that downstream and upstream operations run in two different threads.

Lets have a second look with a non saturating request rate of 10K:

    echo "GET $PROXY_URL/10kb.img" | vegeta attack -insecure -duration=10s -timeout=10s -rate=10000 -keepalive=true | vegeta report

In the unsaturated scenario, which will be the normal mode of operation, the latency is not significantly higher than with NGINX.

## Put Sensepitch Edge in front of NGINX

Assuming your existing inbound reverse proxy is NGINX, here is an example how to augment
your NGINX configuration.

## Admission configuration

### Bypass for webhook calls

Example Stipe
- post uri: POST /module/stripe_official/webhook
- user agent: Stripe/1.0 (+https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks)
- IP: 54.187.174.169

Example Paypal
- post uri: POST /module/paypal/webhookhandler
- user agent: PayPal/AUHR-1.0-1
